            <h2><strong>MY BACKGROUND</strong></h2>
            <p>
                I pursued a practical path with an apprenticeship in commerce after compulsory education. My family's background in hospitality has fueled my interest in the field. I have a passion for building relationships and providing exceptional service. I chose EHL for its prestige and opportunities. I aim to become a leader in the competitive hospitality industry and believe EHL will help me achieve my career goals.
            </p>
            <p>
                After EHL, my goal is to work for my own company that I opened two years ago. You will learn more about it on this page.
